PURPOSE: Build workflows, generate tools via Neurogenesis Engine

GLECGUI: Barespec + Gold Nugget Cards
OUTPUT: Definitions, workflows, skills, MCP server interactions
DELIVERY: Imminence (reality) or Immersion (VR)

CATASORTER: Creates Gold Nugget Cards
CONTENT: Human-defined processes
STATUS: Fine-tuning output

NEUROGENESIS_ENGINE: Tool factory

TRANSFORMATION EXAMPLES

EXAMPLE_1:
PAIN: "We lose track of customer orders"
DISCOVERY: Reverse prompting finds root cause
BUILD: Neurogenesis creates order-tracking MCP server
GOVERN: Claude Skill "order-management-workflow" created
RESULT: Best order visibility in their industry (pain → strength)

EXAMPLE_2:
PAIN: "Manual data entry takes hours"
DISCOVERY: Reverse prompting maps current workflow
BUILD: Neurogenesis creates automation MCP server
GOVERN: Claude Skill instructs tools to auto-process
RESULT: Staff freed for high-value work (bottleneck → efficiency)

---

RECURSIVE NATURE

Box of Prompts built Imminence by existing as an idea.
Box of Prompts is now part of Imminence.
Box of Prompts continues building Imminence outward and inward.
The origin lives inside what it created, still creating.

PHASE: Infrastructure build
FOCUS: Bulletproof servers, bulletproof workflows
NEXT: GUI controls (knobs, buttons, sliders) for monitored processes
FUTURE: Consumer-facing service, vendor onboarding, field service launch, FestiVRal/FestiMall launch
